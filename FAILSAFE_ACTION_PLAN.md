## ⚠️ BUILD IN SMALL CHUNKS - PREVENTS CRASHES

**CRITICAL: Claude will crash if you try to do too much at once!**

### Chunk Rules:
1. **ONE file at a time** - Create one file, upload it, confirm it works
2. **STOP after each section** - Each checklist part has sections. Stop after each one.
3. **Max 2-3 files per message** - Don't try to create 10 files at once
4. **Test before continuing** - Make sure each piece works before moving on
5. **Save progress frequently** - Update this FAILSAFE file after completing sections

### Workflow Pattern:
```
1. Read the next section of the checklist
2. Create 1-2 files from that section
3. Upload via FTP
4. Test that it works
5. Tell the user "Section X complete, ready for next section?"
6. Wait for user to say continue
7. Repeat
```

### If Running Low on Context:
- Stop and summarize what's been done
- Update the progress tracker in this file
- Tell user to start a new chat with the resume prompt
- New chat picks up where you left off

## ❌ RULES - DO NOT BREAK THESE

1. **DO NOT skip checklist parts** - build in order 1→2→3→4...
2. **DO NOT make up code** - use the code in the checklist
3. **DO NOT skip steps within a part** - every checkbox matters
4. **DO NOT modify the checklist** - follow it exactly
5. **DO NOT advertise VIP** - it's a secret system
6. **DO NOT put anyone except seige235@yahoo.com on St. Louis server**
7. **DO NOT generate WireGuard keys in browser** - must be server-side (Part 9A)
8. **DO NOT try to build too much at once** - small chunks prevent crashes
9. **DO NOT continue without testing** - verify each piece works

---

## ✅ RULES - ALWAYS DO THESE

1. **READ the checklist part fully before starting**
2. **FOLLOW each step in order**
3. **TEST after each major section**
4. **UPDATE this file** - mark parts complete as you finish them
5. **ASK the user if something is unclear** - don't guess
6. **USE FTP to upload files** - don't just show code
