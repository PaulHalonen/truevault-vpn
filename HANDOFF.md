Password: TrueVault2026!
```

### VIP Users (SECRET - Never Advertise):
```
paulhalonen@gmail.com → 10 devices, all access
seige235@yahoo.com → 999 devices, dedicated server 2
```

### Test URLs:
```
Landing: https://vpn.the-truth-publishing.com/

## ⚠️ BEFORE YOU TEST - DO THESE FIRST!

### 1. Rename Database Setup File (SECURITY!)
The database setup script should only run once. Rename it:

**Via FTP:**
- Rename: `admin/setup-databases.php`
- To: `admin/setup-databases.php.bak`

This prevents anyone from re-running the database setup.

### 2. Update Real Server Keys
Visit this URL once to populate real server public keys:
```
https://vpn.the-truth-publishing.com/admin/update-servers.php
```

This will update all 4 VPN servers with correct keys and settings.
