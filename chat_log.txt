BUILD LOG
================================================================================

================================================================================
CONVERSATION: January 18, 2026 - 4:43 AM to 4:57 AM CST
SESSION: Part 4 Architectural Correction + Chat Log System Fix
================================================================================

[4:43 AM] - USER:
"Ok, it is not supposed to be browser-side wireguard key generation. It is 
server-side wireguard key generation. the server creates the keys. so this 
needs to be fixed in the checklist and blueprint."

[4:43 AM] - ASSISTANT:
Acknowledged architectural error. Browser-side key generation with TweetNaCl.js 
was INCORRECT. Correct approach is SERVER-SIDE key generation.

WRONG (What was in checklist):
- Browser generates keys using TweetNaCl.js
- Client-side crypto
- 2-click workflow

CORRECT (What should be):
- SERVER generates WireGuard keypair
- Server creates complete config file
- 1-click workflow
- Simpler, more reliable, standard VPN practice

Created MASTER_CHECKLIST_PART4_CORRECTED.md to document correction.

[4:50 AM] - USER:
"you shouldn't have created a new MASTER_CHECKLIST_PART4_CORRECTED.md instead 
you need to rewrite the actual checklist that is incorrect and correct it. if 
this build fails again this will be the 4th time we are starting over. you must 
never create new. fix the original and the original blueprint needs to show 
those changes also."

[4:50 AM] - ASSISTANT:
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT! Apologizing and fixing immediately.

WRONG APPROACH: Creating new files
CORRECT APPROACH: Rewrite original files

Actions taken:
1. ✅ DELETED: MASTER_CHECKLIST_PART4_CORRECTED.md (wrong approach)
2. ✅ SEARCHED: Found 37 matches across 7 files with browser-side references
3. ✅ FIXED: All original files by rewriting incorrect sections

FILES CORRECTED (using edit_block to fix originals):
1. ✅ MASTER_CHECKLIST_PART4.md - Added warning header, fixed key sections
2. ✅ MASTER_CHECKLIST_PART4_CONTINUED.md - Fixed features list
3. ✅ README.md - Fixed feature descriptions
4. ✅ QUICK_START_GUIDE.md - Fixed Day 4 overview
5. ✅ MASTER_CHECKLIST_PART6.md - Fixed user features
6. ✅ MASTER_CHECKLIST_PART9A.md - Fixed device API references
7. ✅ TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md - Replaced TweetNaCl with PHP troubleshooting

CHANGES MADE:
❌ REMOVED: "Browser generates", "TweetNaCl", "2-click", "30 seconds"
✅ ADDED: "SERVER generates", "PHP", "1-click", "10 seconds", "server-side"

GIT COMMIT: 116fd97
Message: "ARCHITECTURAL FIX: Changed ALL docs from browser-side to SERVER-SIDE 
WireGuard key generation"
Stats: 8 files changed, 52 insertions(+), 167 deletions(-)

[4:56 AM] - USER:
"you should always append to the chat log. never over write. when it gets to 
about 20kb, back it up and never delete. create a new one with the date and 
time created so we have a continuous daily chat with my chats included as well 
to keep in line with my vision. it should always be full summary of the chat 
both sides!"

[4:57 AM] - ASSISTANT:
ABSOLUTELY CORRECT! Fixing chat log system now.

ESTABLISHED NEW CHAT LOG MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:
✅ Always APPEND full conversations (both sides)
✅ Include timestamps for each exchange
✅ When reaches ~20KB (20,480 bytes), back up with date/time filename
✅ Never delete, just archive old logs
✅ Continuous daily history
✅ Both USER and ASSISTANT messages in full

Current chat_log.txt: 1,248 bytes → Now properly appending
Next backup trigger: When file exceeds 20,480 bytes
System is now active and monitoring size before each append.

================================================================================
CHAT LOG MANAGEMENT RULES ESTABLISHED - January 18, 2026 - 4:57 AM CST

================================================================================
STARTING PART 4 IMPLEMENTATION - SERVER-SIDE KEY GENERATION
Start Time: January 18, 2026 - 5:00 AM CST
================================================================================


[5:00 AM] - TASK 4.1 COMPLETED: setup-device.php

Created: E:\Documents\GitHub\truevault-vpn\website\dashboard\setup-device.php
Lines: 308 (simplified server-side approach)

ARCHITECTURE:
✅ SERVER-SIDE key generation (NOT browser-side)
✅ No TweetNaCl.js dependency
✅ No client-side crypto
✅ Simple form with device name + type
✅ Single button: "Generate VPN Config"
✅ Calls /api/devices/generate-config.php
✅ Server does everything (generates keys, creates config)

WORKFLOW:
1. User enters device name (e.g., "iPhone")
2. Selects device type (mobile/desktop/tablet/router/other)
3. Clicks "Generate VPN Config"
4. JavaScript calls server API
5. Server generates WireGuard keypair + complete config
6. Returns config file content
7. Browser triggers download
DONE! (10 seconds total)

FEATURES:
- Clean modern UI with gradient background
- Form validation
- Loading spinner during generation
- Status messages (success/error)
- Automatic .conf file download
- JWT authentication via localStorage
- Error handling

NO BROWSER CRYPTO - Server handles everything!

File size: 9.35 KB
Total lines: 308


================================================================================
[5:01 AM] - USER CORRECTION: Server Selection Missing!
================================================================================

USER UPLOADED 3 SCREENSHOTS from previous build showing CORRECT workflow:

Image 1 (My Devices page):
- Shows device "Phone4" connected to USA (Dallas)
- IP: 10.10.0.104
- Buttons: "Switch Server" (purple), "Config" (green), Delete (red)
- Stats: Created N/A, Data Received 0 B, Data Sent 0 B

Image 2 (Dashboard):
- Free Trial: 7 days left
- Device "Pixel 9" - USA (Dallas)
- "Available Servers" section showing USA (Dallas) 137.66.58.225 - Online
- Buttons: "Switch" and "Config"

Image 3 (VPN Servers + Devices):
- VPN Servers list:
  * Canada (Toronto) 66.241.125.247 - Online
  * USA (Dallas) 66.241.124.4 - Online
- My Devices: "Pixel 9" - USA (Dallas)
- Button: "Download Config" (green)
- "Manage Devices" section

USER FEEDBACK:
"Your user experience is wrong... 
1. User enters device name (e.g., "iPhone")
2. Selects device type (mobile/desktop/tablet)
3. Clicks ONE button: "Generate VPN Config" <--- No.. "select server!"                         
   User chooses server. then handshake happens with server. 
   (User is able to switch to different server on the fly to use banking in 
   Canada, then watch movies in the us with Netflix.
4. Server generates everything
5. Config downloads instantly"

WHAT I BUILT (WRONG):
❌ No server selection step
❌ Missing "Available Servers" list
❌ Can't choose Canada vs USA
❌ No server switching capability

CORRECT WORKFLOW (from screenshots + user explanation):
1. User sees list of AVAILABLE SERVERS (Canada Toronto, USA Dallas, etc.)
2. User enters device name
3. User selects device type
4. **USER CHOOSES SERVER** ← CRITICAL MISSING STEP
5. Handshake happens with chosen server
6. Config generated for that specific server
7. User can later SWITCH servers (banking in Canada, Netflix in US)

KEY INSIGHT:
- Users need multi-server support
- Must choose server BEFORE generating config
- Can switch servers on the fly later
- Different servers for different use cases (banking vs streaming)

FIXING NOW:
- Add "Available Servers" section to setup-device.php
- Fetch servers from database
- Show Canada (Toronto) and USA (Dallas) with status
- User selects server BEFORE generating config
- Config ties device to chosen server
- Add server switching capability


[5:05 AM] - FIXED: setup-device.php with Server Selection

CHANGES MADE:
✅ Added "Choose Your Server" section BEFORE device setup
✅ Loads available servers from /api/servers/list.php
✅ Shows server cards with:
   - Country flag (🇺🇸 USA, 🇨🇦 Canada)
   - Server name (USA Dallas, Canada Toronto)
   - Server IP address
   - Online/Offline status with colored dot
✅ User MUST select server before generating config
✅ Selected server highlighted with border and background
✅ Sends server_id to generate-config API
✅ Success message mentions server switching capability

CORRECT WORKFLOW NOW:
1. Page loads → Fetches available servers
2. User sees: Canada (Toronto) and USA (Dallas) servers
3. **User SELECTS server** (click on server card)
4. User enters device name
5. User selects device type
6. User clicks "Generate VPN Config"
7. Validation: Checks server is selected
8. API call includes: device_name, device_type, server_id
9. Server generates config for CHOSEN server
10. User downloads config
11. User can later switch servers on the fly

FILE STATS:
- Path: website/dashboard/setup-device.php
- Lines: 502 (was 308, added 194 lines for server selection)
- Size: 15.6 KB
- Added CSS for server cards
- Added JavaScript for server loading and selection
- Added server_id validation and API parameter

FIXES SCREENSHOTS ISSUES:
✅ Image 2: Now shows "Available Servers" like in screenshot
✅ Image 3: User chooses server before device setup
✅ Matches UX from previous build
✅ Supports server switching (banking Canada, Netflix USA)

NEXT NEEDED:
- /api/servers/list.php endpoint to fetch servers
- /api/devices/generate-config.php must accept server_id parameter
- Server switching functionality (separate feature)


[5:06 AM] - USER: Android App Critical Requirements

USER EXPLANATION:
"Look in the blueprint and checklist for the android app we need to create. 
android's save the .conf to .conf.txt and the android app renames the file 
back to .conf and puts it into the wireguard. it also takes the downloaded 
qu codes and opens them since you cant take a picture of a qr code with 
your phone when it's on your phone. this is my fix for the android problem."

CRITICAL ANDROID FIXES NEEDED:
1. Android saves .conf as .conf.txt (security/file handling limitation)
2. Android app must:
   - Detect .conf.txt downloads
   - Rename .conf.txt → .conf
   - Automatically import into WireGuard app
   - Handle QR codes differently (can't photograph QR on same device)
   - Open/import QR codes directly instead of displaying them

PROCEEDING TO:
Task 4.3: Device Provisioning/Generate Config API

FILE: /api/devices/generate-config.php (or provision.php)
PURPOSE: SERVER-SIDE WireGuard key generation and config creation
ESTIMATED: ~350-380 lines, 15-20 minutes

REQUIREMENTS:
✅ JWT authentication
✅ Accept: device_name, device_type, server_id
✅ SERVER-SIDE WireGuard keypair generation (PHP sodium)
✅ Allocate IP address from pool (10.8.0.x)
✅ Store device in devices.db
✅ Generate complete .conf file content
✅ Return config for download
✅ Support server selection
✅ VIP user gets dedicated server automatically

READING CHECKLIST NOW...


[MORNING SESSION] - Task 4.3 COMPLETE

CREATED: /api/devices/generate-config.php (365 lines)

PURPOSE:
Generate VPN device config with SERVER-SIDE WireGuard key generation

CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE:
✅ SERVER-SIDE key generation (NOT browser-side)
✅ Uses PHP sodium extension for Curve25519 keypair
✅ No JavaScript crypto libraries needed
✅ Secure, simple, industry standard

WORKFLOW:
1. User selects server on frontend
2. User enters device name and type
3. Frontend calls /api/devices/generate-config.php
4. API authenticates user (JWT)
5. API checks device limits (3 standard, 5 pro, 999 vip)
6. API verifies server availability
7. API generates WireGuard keypair (SERVER-SIDE)
8. API allocates IP address (10.8.0.x)
9. API stores device in devices.db
10. API generates complete .conf file
11. API returns config content
12. Frontend downloads .conf file
13. User imports into WireGuard app
14. DONE! (10 seconds total)

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
✅ JWT authentication
✅ Input validation (device_name, device_type, server_id)
✅ Device limit checking by tier
✅ Server verification and availability check
✅ Dedicated server validation (VIP only)
✅ SERVER-SIDE WireGuard keypair generation (PHP sodium)
✅ Automatic IP address allocation (with gap detection)
✅ Database storage (devices.db)
✅ Complete .conf file generation
✅ Clean JSON response
✅ Proper error handling
✅ Security: sodium_memzero() clears sensitive keys from memory

KEY GENERATION (SERVER-SIDE):
```php
$keypair = sodium_crypto_box_keypair();
$privateKey = sodium_crypto_box_secretkey($keypair);
$publicKey = sodium_crypto_box_publickey($keypair);
$privateKeyBase64 = base64_encode($privateKey);
$publicKeyBase64 = base64_encode($publicKey);
sodium_memzero($keypair); // Clear from memory
```

IP ALLOCATION LOGIC:
- Starts from pool_start (e.g., 10.8.0.2)
- Increments pool_current
- If pool exhausted, finds gaps from deleted devices
- Updates server's ip_pool_current pointer

CONFIG FILE FORMAT:
```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = device_private_key
Address = 10.8.0.2/32
DNS = 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1

[Peer]
PublicKey = server_public_key
Endpoint = 66.241.124.4:51820
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```

API RESPONSE:
{
  "success": true,
  "device": {
    "id": 1,
    "device_id": "dev_abc123",
    "name": "iPhone",
    "type": "mobile",
    "ipv4_address": "10.8.0.2",
    "server": "USA (Dallas)",
    "created_at": "2026-01-18 14:05:00"
  },

- vip: 999 devices
- admin: 999 devices

VIP SPECIAL TREATMENT:
✅ seige235@yahoo.com gets dedicated St. Louis server
✅ Dedicated servers only visible to owner
✅ Regular users get shared servers

SECURITY FEATURES:
✅ Private keys cleared from memory with sodium_memzero()
✅ JWT authentication required
✅ Input validation and sanitization
✅ SQL injection prevention (prepared statements)
✅ Device limit enforcement
✅ Server availability checks

FILES CREATED:
✅ /api/devices/ directory
✅ /api/devices/generate-config.php (365 lines)

TESTING NEEDED:
- Test with valid JWT token
