USER REQUEST:
"Yes, but you don't seem to be doing it in small chunks because 
the chat keeps crashing and resetting back to this spot. maybe 
you should first create a new handoff for a new chat and make 
sure you create for it a comprehensive summary of this entire 
chat and force it to only follow the checklist and blueprint 
and make sure my side of the conversation is in the chat log 
also. make sure the entire chat log is preserved. always backup 
the chat log after 30kb so it doesn't cause claude desktop to 
crash. never overwrite. backup or append always."

CLAUDE ACTION:
Creating comprehensive handoff for next session...
