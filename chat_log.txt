✅ 9.8.1 - auto-provision.php EXISTS (full ServerProvisioner class)
✅ 9.8.2 - All 3 scripts EXIST (install-wireguard.sh, change-server-password.py, create-client-config.sh)
⬜ 9.8.3 - Testing workflow (NOT DONE - requires manual SSH testing)
⬜ 9.8.4 - PayPal webhook does NOT have dedicated plan trigger

TASK 9.9 - Admin Troubleshooting Panel:
🔶 diagnostics-panel.php EXISTS (partial - has HTML structure)
⬜ Needs: Fix scripts creation
⬜ Needs: PHP endpoints to trigger scripts

TASK 9.10 - Automation Workflows:

REMAINING WORK FOR PART 9:
1. Add dedicated plan detection to paypal-webhook.php
2. Complete diagnostics-panel.php with fix scripts
3. Add automation workflow entries
4. Test (but testing is for Part 20)
