  □ Create folder: databases/
  □ Set permissions: chmod 755 databases/
```

**STEP 4: UPDATE CHAT LOG AFTER EACH PART**
```
write_file(
    path="E:\Documents\GitHub\truevault-vpn\chat_log.txt",
    content="[Date/Time] - Completed Part X: [Title]",
    mode="append"
)
```

================================================================================
HOW TO WRITE (FORMAT AND STYLE)
================================================================================

**USE THIS STRUCTURE:**

```markdown
# PART X: [TITLE]

## X.1 [SECTION NAME]

### [Subsection]

**[Explanation]**

Complete PHP code with ALL functions:

```php
<?php
// /path/to/file.php
// Complete working code, not snippets!

function exampleFunction() {
    // Full implementation
    // Error handling included
    // Comments explaining why
}
?>
```

**Why this works:**
- Explanation of the approach
- Edge cases handled
- Security considerations

---

## X.2 [NEXT SECTION]
```

**INCLUDE IN EVERY CODE EXAMPLE:**
- Complete file paths
- All required functions
- Error handling
- Security checks
- Comments explaining logic
- Why design decisions were made this way

================================================================================
CRITICAL BUSINESS FEATURES TO DOCUMENT
================================================================================

**SECRET VIP SYSTEM (NEVER ADVERTISED!):**
- paulhalonen@gmail.com = Owner (all access, no payment, admin panel)
- seige235@yahoo.com = Dedicated VIP (Server 2 ONLY, exclusive, no payment)
- Auto-detected during registration
- Completely invisible in UI
- Document thoroughly but explain it's SECRET

**30-MINUTE BUSINESS TRANSFER (KEY SELLING POINT!):**
In Part 14, document this process step-by-step:
1. Update settings.db → business.owner_email
2. Update settings.db → PayPal credentials
3. Update users.db → vip_list table
4. Test system (register → pay → connect VPN)
5. DONE in 30 minutes!

**100% DATABASE-DRIVEN (NO HARDCODING!):**
- All business settings in settings.db
- All themes/colors in theme_colors table
- All pricing in settings.db
- This enables the 30-minute transfer!

**4 VPN SERVERS (ALREADY PROVISIONED):**
1. Server 1 (NY): 66.94.103.91 - Shared
2. Server 2 (STL): 144.126.133.253 - VIP Dedicated for seige235@yahoo.com
3. Server 3 (Dallas): 66.241.124.4 - Streaming
4. Server 4 (Toronto): 66.241.125.247 - Canadian

================================================================================
REFERENCE DATA YOU'LL NEED
================================================================================

**PAYPAL CREDENTIALS:**
- Client ID: ActD2XQKe8EkUNI8eZakmhR8964d2kAdh7rcpbkm2rbr8rrtEOoOdmoj50FtXmy1XLYzALL5ogvxcagk
- Secret: EIc2idTcm_YjKf4pNxXpRr_vBt0Ebb3FCp71H2fTI3T9NAi_iAvlrwYbEaidmP23IynWSqfP6nkAXwGN

**DATABASES (9 separate SQLite files):**
All schemas are in Part 2 of MASTER_BLUEPRINT.md - reference them!

**FILE PATHS:**
- Main site: /home/eybn38fwc55z/public_html/vpn.the-truth-publishing.com/
- Databases: /home/eybn38fwc55z/public_html/vpn.the-truth-publishing.com/databases/

================================================================================
YOUR FIRST ACTION (START HERE!)
================================================================================

1. Read the last 50 lines of MASTER_BLUEPRINT.md:
   ```
   view(path="E:\Documents\GitHub\truevault-vpn\reference\MASTER_BLUEPRINT.md", tail=50)
   ```

2. Start writing Part 3 (Authentication) by appending:
   ```
   write_file(
       path="E:\Documents\GitHub\truevault-vpn\reference\MASTER_BLUEPRINT.md",
       content="[Part 3 content here - 25-30 lines at a time]",
       mode="append"
   )
   ```

3. Continue with Parts 4-15, then the massive checklist

4. Update chat log after each major part

================================================================================
FINAL REMINDERS

END - NOW START WORKING! 
================================================================================

================================================================================
📚 CRITICAL: REFERENCE MATERIALS YOU MUST READ FIRST! 📚
================================================================================

BEFORE writing Parts 3-15, you MUST read these files to understand what to build:

================================================================================
STEP 0: READ THESE FILES FIRST (BEFORE WRITING ANYTHING!)
================================================================================

**1. UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT (WHAT IS TRUEVAULT VPN?):**
```
view(path="E:\Documents\GitHub\truevault-vpn\concept.txt")
```
This explains:
- What TrueVault VPN is (advanced VPN with unique features)
- Why it exists (4 VPN concepts combined into one)
- What features it has (camera dashboard, parental controls, etc.)

**2. SEE WHAT WAS ALREADY WRITTEN (USE AS TEMPLATE!):**
```
view(path="E:\Documents\GitHub\truevault-vpn\reference\OLD_INCOMPLETE\TRUEVAULT_COMPLETE_BLUEPRINT_FINAL.md", head=200)
```
This file contains Parts 3-15 already written! Use it as a guide:
- Part 3: Authentication & Authorization (JWT, VIP detection, 2FA)
- Part 4: Payment & Billing (PayPal API, webhooks, grace periods)
- Part 5: VPN Core (WireGuard, device provisioning)
- Part 6: Advanced Features (Parental Controls, Camera Dashboard)
- Part 7: Security & Monitoring (Auto-Tracking Hacker System)
- Part 8: Admin Control Panel
- Part 9-15: Theme system, marketing, API docs, etc.

⚠️ **PROBLEM WITH OLD FILE:** It starts at Part 3 and is missing Parts 1-2 (concept, overview, databases)
✅ **YOUR JOB:** Copy/adapt Parts 3-15 from OLD file into MASTER_BLUEPRINT.md to create ONE complete file!

**3. UNDERSTAND THE AUTOMATION SYSTEM:**
```
view(path="E:\Documents\GitHub\truevault-vpn\AUTOMATION_SYSTEM_USER_GUIDE.md.txt")
```
This explains:
- Complete automation system for business operations
- Email workflows, billing automation, support tickets
- How everything ties together

**4. UNDERSTAND THE NETWORK SCANNER:**
```
view(path="E:\Documents\GitHub\truevault-vpn\truthvault_scanner.py")
view(path="E:\Documents\GitHub\truevault-vpn\README.txt")
```
This shows:
- Network device discovery system
- How it integrates with TrueVault VPN
- MAC address vendor detection

**5. CHECK THE 2.JPG SCREENSHOT:**
```
view(path="E:\Documents\GitHub\truevault-vpn\2.jpg")
```
This may show UI/design elements to include.

================================================================================
YOUR ACTUAL WORKFLOW (REVISED!)
================================================================================

**STEP 1: READ ALL REFERENCE MATERIALS (30 minutes)**
Read the 5 files above to understand:
- What TrueVault VPN does
- What features it has
- What code was already written
- How systems integrate

**STEP 2: REVIEW WHAT'S IN MASTER_BLUEPRINT.MD**
```
view(path="E:\Documents\GitHub\truevault-vpn\reference\MASTER_BLUEPRINT.md", tail=100)
```
See where we stopped (end of Part 2 - Database Architecture)

**STEP 3: COPY/ADAPT FROM OLD FILE**

Open the OLD file and systematically copy each part:

```
# Read Part 3 from OLD file
view(path="E:\Documents\GitHub\truevault-vpn\reference\OLD_INCOMPLETE\TRUEVAULT_COMPLETE_BLUEPRINT_FINAL.md", offset=0, length=500)

# Copy to MASTER_BLUEPRINT.md (append mode!)
write_file(
    path="E:\Documents\GitHub\truevault-vpn\reference\MASTER_BLUEPRINT.md",
    content="[Part 3 content from OLD file - adapted with improvements]",
    mode="append"
)

# Continue with Part 4, 5, 6, etc.
```

**STEP 4: ENHANCE WITH MISSING DETAILS**

The OLD file has Parts 3-15 but may be missing:
- Complete code examples (add them!)
- Error handling (enhance it!)
- Security details (improve it!)
- Implementation notes (add them!)

**STEP 5: ADD THE MASSIVE CHECKLIST**

After copying/enhancing Parts 3-15, write Section 3: Implementation Checklist

)

// 4. Continue with Part 4, Part 5, etc.
```

================================================================================
YOU'RE NOT WRITING FROM SCRATCH - YOU'RE CONSOLIDATING!
================================================================================

**The work is 80% done!** The OLD file has Parts 3-15.

**Your job:**
1. Read OLD file to see what was written
2. Copy it into MASTER_BLUEPRINT.md section by section
3. Enhance with better code, explanations, details
4. Add the checklist (the only truly new part!)

This is a CONSOLIDATION task, not a "write from scratch" task!

================================================================================
CRITICAL FILES TO READ BEFORE STARTING
================================================================================

**MUST READ (in this order):**
1. concept.txt - Understand what TrueVault VPN is
2. OLD_INCOMPLETE/TRUEVAULT_COMPLETE_BLUEPRINT_FINAL.md - See Parts 3-15 already written
3. MASTER_BLUEPRINT.md (tail) - See where we stopped
4. AUTOMATION_SYSTEM_USER_GUIDE.md.txt - Understand automation features
5. truthvault_scanner.py - Understand network scanner

**THEN:**
- Copy Parts 3-15 from OLD file to MASTER file
- Enhance with improvements
- Add massive checklist (new!)

================================================================================
END - NOW YOU KNOW WHAT TO BUILD AND WHERE TO GET IT!
================================================================================
